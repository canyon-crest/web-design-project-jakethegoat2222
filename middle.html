<h3>Middle School</h3>

<p>
When going to <a href="https://pt.sduhsd.net/" target="_blank">middle school </a>, social anxiety affected all new 7th graders. This caused major shifts in everyone's views including me. The designated friend group became more selective, more independent. <span class="highlight">Now, friend groups would not even interact with each other and would just talk about new things such as video games, homework, clothes, etc.</span> As we went to 8th grade we began to interact with other people more as we felt more comfortable in the new school. Free time began to lessen due to homework, extracurriculars, and the preparations that came with the transition to high school.
