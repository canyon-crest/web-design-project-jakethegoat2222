    <h3>Elemntary School</h3>

    <p>
Upon entering <a href="https://sr.sbsd.k12.ca.us/" target="_blank">elementary school </a>, because I went to a different school before, I had no friends. But because of the young age, I found it fairly easy to find friends and fit in. <span class="highlight">Throughout my elementary years I found myself playing football, soccer, and basketball with friends at school and upon getting home doing my own thing.</span> Further as I found more free time but less activities to do, I began watching basketball and soccer to fill up the time that remained. As time went on and I began getting older, we then began to split into designated friend groups, playing sports and activities with your own friend group.

<h3>Middle School</h3>

<p>
When going to <a href="https://pt.sduhsd.net/" target="_blank">middle school </a>, social anxiety affected all new 7th graders. This caused major shifts in everyone's views including me. The designated friend group became more selective, more independent. <span class="highlight">Now, friend groups would not even interact with each other and would just talk about new things such as video games, homework, clothes, etc.</span> As we went to 8th grade we began to interact with other people more as we felt more comfortable in the new school. Free time began to lessen due to homework, extracurriculars, and the preparations that came with the transition to high school.

<h3>Highschool</h3>

<p>
  As I entered into <a href="https://sduhsd.net" target="_blank">high school </a>, I began worrying about everything, grades, sports, and extracurriculars. It was, according to everyone, when school began to matter and affect your life. Although many did not mean it to give pressure, it still did. <span class="highlight">It caused me to work, study, and have late nights.</span> The free time I once had so much of, shrunk to none. I would stress over bad tests, missing assignments, and tardies. Every small, little thing caused stress to occur throughout my head. But as time went on, I got used to it, most of the stress became normal, to a point where it felt natural.
