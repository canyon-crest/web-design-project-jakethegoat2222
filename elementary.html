Upon entering <a href="https://sr.sbsd.k12.ca.us/" target="_blank">elementary school </a>, because I went to a different school before, I had no friends. But because of the young age, I found it fairly easy to find friends and fit in. <span class="highlight">Throughout my elementary years I found myself playing football, soccer, and basketball with friends at school and upon getting home doing my own thing.</span> Further as I found more free time but less activities to do, I began watching basketball and soccer to fill up the time that remained. As time went on and I began getting older, we then began to split into designated friend groups, playing sports and activities with your own friend group.
