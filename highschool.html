  As I entered into <a href="https://sduhsd.net" target="_blank">high school </a>, I began worrying about everything, grades, sports, and extracurriculars. It was, according to everyone, when school began to matter and affect your life. Although many did not mean it to give pressure, it still did. <span class="highlight">It caused me to work, study, and have late nights.</span> The free time I once had so much of, shrunk to none. I would stress over bad tests, missing assignments, and tardies. Every small, little thing caused stress to occur throughout my head. But as time went on, I got used to it, most of the stress became normal, to a point where it felt natural.
